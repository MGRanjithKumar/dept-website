		  							The history of the department dates back to 1930 when it was started as Telecommunication division in the department of Electrical Engineering. The department has the distinction of being the first institution in India to start a Under Graduate programme in Telecommunication Engineering in the year 1945. The first Post Graduate programme in Communication systems was introduced in 1963 and subsequently the PG programmes in Applied Electronics, Medical Electronics, VLSI design and Biomedical Engineering was introduced.

		 						    The DECE has always enjoyed a respectable status among the major recruiters in India and the excellent performance of its students across the industry has enabled the department to maintain its strong brand image. Presently, the research students are working in the areas of Adhoc Network,Optical Network,Bio-Medical Signal Processing,Medical Image Processing,VLSI Architecture etc. The Department has more industrial collaborations with global industries such as Altera,Renesas,Cypress Semiconductors,Texas Instruments which provide opportunities for students to get good exposure in hardware design.
